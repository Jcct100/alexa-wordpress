# alexa-wordpress

I built a voice app for a school. I used Lambda Function and Node.js. This was my first time I built a live-project with Node.js and Lambda function. I learn how to build an Alexa skill by reading the documentations online. I also played around with  Word Press API by using it in the Alexa app for research and development.
